    "It would not be wrong to say that technology advancement is the leading factor for growth and development in the 21st century. Countries who lead in technical innovation are growing the fastest and people working within the tech industry are generally enjoying higher than average pay. Therefore, I wanted to understand the demographics of the building blocks of this technology industry, i.e. the developers. Analyzing the demographics of the developers around the world would help me draw conclusions about overall diversity and inclusion within this booming sector. For example, is technology advancement reaching every corner of the world, or is it clustered around a few pockets of the world? Is technology accessible and reachable to all genders and all races equally or does certain sections of the society still enjoy undue privileges? I would also like to examine how this social-economic trend evolving with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study would help to unearth the existing biases and inequality within the developer community. These biases and differences can be seen as a proxy of the developing world in general. Therefore, I believe that this study is deeply rooted as human-centered. Since our cohort is also a part of this community, I am hopeful that the analysis would help us realize our own prejudices and make us more aware of them as we go into the workforce. The study would help us to amend our behavior, make the required changes in our process and set new targets to improve the diversity, respect and inclusion within the developer community. \n"

    "The dataset that I plan to use for my analysis has been generated through the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey that was conducted by Stack Overflow from February 5 to February 28 in 2020. The data contains response of 65,000 professional and aspiring software developers, representing 186 countries around the world. The dataset contains information about the demographics of the respondents such as gender, nationality, ethnicity, years of experience, education, compensation, etc.  The survey was anonymous and does not contain any personally identifiable information.\n",

It is likely that a particular section of society is more likely or less likely to participate in a survey, and hence the dataset may not provide proportional representation for that particular section of society.\n"
