    "It would not be wrong to say that technology advancement is the leading factor for growth and development in the 21st century. Countries who lead in technical innovation are growing the fastest and people working within the tech industry are generally enjoying higher than average pay. Therefore, I wanted to understand the demographics of the building blocks of this technology industry, i.e. the developers. Analyzing the demographics of the developers around the world would help me draw conclusions about overall diversity and inclusion within this booming sector. For example, is technology advancement reaching every corner of the world, or is it clustered around a few pockets of the world? Is technology accessible and reachable to all genders and all races equally or does certain sections of the society still enjoy undue privileges? I would also like to examine how this social-economic trend evolving with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study would help to unearth the existing biases and inequality within the developer community. These biases and differences can be seen as a proxy of the developing world in general. Therefore, I believe that this study is deeply rooted as human-centered. Since our cohort is also a part of this community, I am hopeful that the analysis would help us realize our own prejudices and make us more aware of them as we go into the workforce. The study would help us to amend our behavior, make the required changes in our process and set new targets to improve the diversity, respect and inclusion within the developer community. \n"
